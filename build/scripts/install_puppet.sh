# Create symlink for the st2/ puppet module in the Pupept code directory.
# This allows us to make changes locally, outside of the VM then automatically available
# within the VM so you can run `puppet agent -t` and it will just work!
#
# FYI the local puppet-st2/ directory is automatically mounted as /vagrant
#     inside the vagrant VM when it comes up, that's why we're linking /vagrant as st2/
