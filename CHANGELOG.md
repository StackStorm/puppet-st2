  Contributed by @bishopbm1

## 2.0.0 (Feb 15, 2020)

- Added new parameter `st2::python_version` that controls the version of python to install.
  This was added so that OSes that don't come with Python 3 by default, can install Python 3.
  The default is `'system'` and the system `python` package will be installed,
  whatever version that is for your OS.
  To explicitly install Python 3.6 on CentOS 7, pass in `'3.6'`.
  To install Python 3.6 on Ubuntu 16.04 pass in `'python3.6'`. On Ubuntu 16.04 you'll
  also need to pass in `st2::python_enable_unsafe_repo: true` in order to enable the deadsnakes
  PPA (Feature)

- Removed tags for auth system development dependencies (PAM and LDAP) that caused issues
  when declaring packages such as `gcc`. (Bug Fix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Corrected `logging` setting for `api`, `auth` and `stream` to point at the
  `/etc/st2/logging.<service>.gunicorn.conf` logging config files, the current default. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Add new parameter `st2::ssl_cert_manage` to allow users to disable this module from
  managing the SSL certificate used by nginx. This flag defaults to the old behavior
  of `true`, and generates a self-signed certificate. If a users sets this to `false`
  they will need to generate their own certificate and place it in `/etc/ssl/st2/st2.crt`
  and private key in `/etc/ssl/st2/st2.key`. There is a future improvement to allow
  these paths to be configurable. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Add support for using MongoDB `4.0` when installing latest StackStorn (`>= 3.3.0`)
  #298 (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Add dependency to `yumrepo_core` to this module that was missed when adding
  repo support previously. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Change the way we handle the `nginx` config from just copying a config file to
  using the native resource types provided by the `puppet-nginx` module.
  Users can now configure the utilized SSL protocol and ciphers along with client
  max body size directly from the `st2` class using the following new parameters:
   - `nginx_client_max_body_size`
   - `nginx_ssl_ciphers`
   - `nginx_ssl_port`
   - `nginx_ssl_protocols`
  Contributed by @nmaludy

  Contributed by @nmaludy

## 1.7.0 (Jun 26, 2020)

- Refactored the system StackStorm repository handling. This replaces the `PackageCloud`
  Puppet module because it was _not_ idempotent. At the same time we've moved the repository
  handling from the old-school `st2::profile::repos` to the new idiomatic
  `st2::repo` (base) and `st2::repo::apt` or `st2::repo::yum` based on OS type.
  This is considered a minor breaking change if you were using the internal class
  `st2::profile::repos`. The replacement class is `st2::repo` and is a direct replacement. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed `/opt/stackstorm/packs` and `/opt/stackstorm/virtualenv` resources to be idempotent
  and manage the ownership of these directories recursively in a much more efficient manner.
  Instead of using the `file` resource with `recurse => true` we now utilize the module
  `npwalker/recursive_file_permissions`. #278 (Bugfix) (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Added Puppet Forge Endorsement badge to show that this is an Approved Puppet module. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed bug in `st2::key_get` task where non-JSON output from the command would throw an
  exception. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed bug in `st2::key_decrypt` causing it to be incompatible with Python 3. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Added an override for the `LC_ALL` environment variable in all Bolt tasks, so that the
  locale is set to UTF-8, preventing a WARNING from being output from the `st2` command line.
  Without this override, new versions of Bolt set the locale to `C` causing a warning and
  preventing the JSON Output from the `st2` command from being parsed properly. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Added new Bolt tasks:
  - `st2::pack_register`: Registers a list of packs based from paths on the filesystem
  - `st2::rule_disable`: Disables a rule
  - `st2::rule_list`: Lists all rules, or just the rules in a given pack
  - `st2::run`: Runs a StackStorm action

  (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Replaced deprecated `stahnma-epel` module with `puppet-epel`. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

## 1.6.0 (Feb 17, 2020)

- Updated to new Puppet style guide where the leading `::` in class names is no longer
  acceptable. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Removed unused `puppet-wget` module dependency. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Define upper-bounds for puppet module dependencies. #282 (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

  #283 (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Added support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Feature)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Dropped support for Ubuntu 14.04 (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

## 1.5.0 (Oct 2, 2019)

- Fixed a bug in the `mistral` Postrgres connection string where passwords weren't
  being URL encoded / escaped. This could lead to potentially bad URL parsing
  when passwords contained certain special characters. To fix this, the
  password in the mistral `connection` parameter is now URL encoded / escaped.
  (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed a bug in the `st2_pack` resource so that when authentication fails, the error
  message about why it failed is shown to the user.
  (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed a bug in the `st2_pack` resource where usernames and passwords were not being
  escaped properly. This only manifested itself with certain special characters.
  (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Modified the build system to utilize `r10k` instead of `librarian-puppet`.
  This change requires the `Puppetfile` using during CI to explicitly call out all dependencies,
  but will result in less maintenance of the `Puppetfile` due to releases of dependent
  modules.
  (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Removed Puppet 4 from build matrix. Puppet 4 has been end-of-life since 2018-12-31.
  (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Already installed packs are now recognized by their configured "ref" variable instead of "name"
  (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @ruriky

## 1.4.0 (Feb 13, 2019)

- Added new tasks to communicate with the StackStorm CLI. The naming standard and parameters
  are modeled after the `st2` CLI command and must be run on the StackStorm node:
   - `st2::key_decrypt` - Decrypts an encrypted key/value pair
   - `st2::key_get` - Retrieves the value for a key from the datastore
   - `st2::key_load` - Loads a list of key/value pairs into the datastore
   - `st2::pack_install` - Installs a list of packs
   - `st2::pack_list` - Get a list of installed packs
   - `st2::pack_remove` - Removes a list of packs
  (Feature)

- Fixed build for new release of `puppet/nginx` causing conflict with `puppetlabs/stdlib`.
  The new version `0.16.0` of `puppet/nginx` requires `puppetlabs/stdlib >= 5.0.0`.
  Several other modules we depend on require `puppetlabs/stdlib < 5.0.0` causing a conflict.
  To fix this, we've pinned `puppet/nginx` to `0.15.0` in the Puppetfiles used
  for testing. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Removed the dependencies because they're no longer used.
    - `puppet/staging`
    - `puppetlabs/gcc`
  (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Puppet 4 is officially deprecated due to it being End of Life on 2018-12-31.
  Support will be removed in a future version. (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed build for Puppet 4. New version of rubygem-update requires Ruby 2.3.0
  and Puppet 4 requires 2.1.x. When running `gem update --system` this updated
  the gem past the installed ruby version, breaking the build. Instead,
  we simply leave the system gems alone during the build.
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Removed the following unused variables from `::st2`:
    - `mistral_git_branch`

- Added authentication for RabbitMQ, by default.
  The authentication options are available in the `::st2` class:
    - `rabbitmq_username` : Username for the new RabbitMQ user (default: `st2admin`)
    - `rabbitmq_password` : Password for the new RabbitMQ user (default: `Ch@ngMe`)
  When upgrading to this new version, this will force a restart of all StackStorm

  This is now also the default when running a brand new installation with a
  `::st2::version` of `latest`, `installed` or `present` (default).
  Existing installations are also upgraded to NodeJS 10 if their `::st2::version`
  is set to `latest`(default) or to a version >= `2.10.0`.
  #219 (Enhancement)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

  `puppetlabs/stdlib` and `puppetlabs/concat` are now at the bottom in order to
  let `librarian-puppet` choose the version of these based on other dependencies
  defined throughout the rest of the file. (Bugfix)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

  GitHub page. The following backends are supported: `flat_file` (default),
  `keystone`, `ldap`, `mongodb`, `pam`. (Feature)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Changed the behavior of `st2` packages. Previously they were automatically
  updating due to the package resources having `ensure  latest` set. Going
  forward, packages will have `ensure => present` set by default  and it will be
  the responsibility of the end user to update the packages. (Change)
  Contributed by @nmaludy

- Fixed `st2_pack` type to properly pass the locale settings of the system

- Some puppet lint problems (notice the whitespace fix and reordering of class params) (Bugfix)
- Dependency issues where the tag being used for the `Service` resource was incorrect (Bugfix)
- Dependency issues where sometimes st2 hadn't been reloaded so the k/v loads would fail (Bugfix)

#### manifests/notices.pp

- Puppet lint fixes for using double quotes without variable interpolation in the string. (Bugfix)

#### manifests/pack.pp

- Unit tests revealed that many of the dependencies of this resource were not declared (group and directories) (Bugfix)
- Pointing at old location for config directory (Bugfix)
- Needed lots of dependency work to ensure resources were created in the proper order (Bugfix)

#### manifests/params.pp

- Broke down the old `st2_server_packages` variable into various components to align more with what ansible-st2 and the "one liner" shell scripts do in their functions. (Enhancement)
- Removed some unused code in the "init provider" section (Enhancement)
- Broke down the old `st2_services` into its components similar to `st2_server_packages`. FYI: The mistral services are handled by the mistral install instead of being grouped together into `st2 server`. (Enhancement)
- Added lots of new parameters for services that were not configured in the past like (nginx, st2web, mongodb, rabbitmq) (Feature)

#### manifests/profile/client.pp

- Removed stale comment (Enhancement)

#### manifests/profile/fullinstall.pp

- Mainly dependency cleanup here. (Bugfix)
- Ensure that packages are installed in the correct order and that there are meaningful anchors in place in case others need to execute tasks at certain points during the install. (Bugfix)

#### manifests/profile/mistral.pp

- This was completely re-written (Enhancement)
- Previously it was performing a lot of tasks manually that i believe st2mistral package now handles for us  (Enhancement)

#### manifests/profile/mongodb.pp

- Completely re-written (Enhancement)
- It now handles auth (did not previously) (Enhancement)
- It also deals with several deficiencies in the puppetlabs-mongodb module. This module has lots of annoying bugs. I'm not at the point where i want to code up a new module myself yet, but we do have to work around several quirks for this to even work (sorry!). (Bugfix)

#### manifests/profile/nginx.pp

- New profile that installs and configures nginx (does not setup st2web config, that is left to the st2web profile) (Feature)
- Utilizes the nginx puppet module to do all of the heavy lifting here (Feature)

#### manifests/profile/nodejs.pp

- Completely re-written (Enhancement)
- Utilizes the nodejs puppet module to do all of the heavy lifting instead of doing it ourselves  (Enhancement)
- Works around a small quirk of the module on RedHat distributions  (BugFix)

#### manifests/profile/postgresql.pp

- Expanded this to properly configure postgres for listening according to the standard installs (shell scripts and ansible-st2) (Enhancement)
- Also ensured that 9.4 is installed on RHEL6 (Bugfix)

#### manifests/profile/rabbitmq.pp

- Greatly simplified by allowing the rabbitmq module to do all of the heavy lifting for us (Enhancement)

#### manifests/profile/repos.pp

- Fixed a bug where we were pointing to an all lowercase URL which caused st2 package installs to fail (Bugfix)

#### manifests/profile/selinux.pp

- Added a class that configures SELinux on RHEL hosts (Feature)

#### manifests/profile/server.pp

- Small changes here related to adding database auth capability (Enhancement)
- Added stanley user creation  (Feature)
- Added datastore crypto creation  (Feature)
- Added additional dependency management (Bugfix)

#### manifests/profile/web.pp

- Completely re-written (Enhancement)
- I don't believe that st2web was complete when this module was last touched, so this class got a complete overhaul (Enhancement)

#### manifests/rbac.pp

- Fixed a few puppet lint errors (Bugfix)
- Fixed an error where the RBAC rules were executed every puppet run (Bugfix)

#### manifests/server/datastore_keys.pp

- New manifest that manages the datastore crypto keys (Feature)

#### manifests/stanley.pp

- Removed unnecessary warning about ssh keys (Bugfix)

#### manifests/user.pp

- Fixed a couple small bugs related to a legacy "robots" group.  (Bugfix)
- This got a pretty big overhaul with regards to SSH key creation. Now, if SSH keys are not present new ones will be created (just like the shell scripts and  ansible-st2) (Bugfix)

#### metadata.json

- Reformatted the whole file to standard JSON formatting scheme (Enhancement)
- Updated module dependencies (some were missing) (Bugfix)
- Added supported OS block (Enhancement)
- Added supported puppet versions block (Enhancement)

#### spec/*

- Lots of small fixes here related to running the tests on various versions of ruby. (Bugfix)
- Finally found a happy medium where all tests now pass  (Bugfix)
- Removed tests for the "st2::package::debian" type that no longer exists  (Bugfix)

#### templates/*

- Removed the following unused templates due to code cleanup and modernizaiton (Enhancement)
  - templates/etc/init.d/mistral-api.erb
  - templates/etc/init.d/mistral.erb
  - templates/etc/init/mistral-api.conf.erb
  - templates/etc/init/mistral.conf.erb
